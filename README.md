The  game locker will encrypt a file with a certain key which we get from the user after playing a game. The score at which the user finishes his/her game acts as the key which later along with the entered password goes through the AES algorithm. Plain text will be user inputed text and Key will be string returned after completion of Game, this plain text and Key will be sent to AES and file will be encrypted with cipher text.Thus, an overall foolproof system is created where nobody can break into otherâ€™s work without the proper key.  
###Game Locker 
Initially user1 sets a password to file 1.docx pasword is  plain= "pwrdfor$file1" key=2341 aes =cipher   key=2341 ciphertext aes dec plain   and he sends the file to user2 through mail or whatsApp  when user2 downloads file and try to open it he will be asked to play a game to check that you are user2.  if user2 play and win the game in  certain way that user1 says to user2(to play game only in this way),   he will be able to open file.  if user2 fails to open file but he finishes game (not in ceratin way set by user1) then he will not able to see message in file
